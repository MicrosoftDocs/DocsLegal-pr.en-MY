# Learn TV Code of Conduct

Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This includes all Microsoft events and gatherings, including on digital platforms, where we seek to create a respectful, friendly, fun, and inclusive experience for all participants.

We expect all digital event participants to uphold the principles of this Code of Conduct, which covers the main digital event and all related activities. We do not tolerate disruptive or disrespectful behaviour, messages, images, or interactions by any party participant, in any form, at any aspect of the program including business and social activities, regardless of location.

Microsoft will not tolerate harassment or discrimination based on age, ancestry, colour, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental disability, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable local laws, regulations, and ordinances.

We encourage everyone to assist in creating a welcoming and safe environment. Please report any concerns, harassing behaviour, suspicious, or disruptive activity to Business Conduct Hotline (1-877-320-MSFT or buscond@microsoft.com). Microsoft reserves the right to refuse admittance to or remove any person from any Microsoft event or digital platform at any time at its sole discretion.
